            <h3>JATAYU'S EARTH CENTER </h3>

            <br>
            <p>
                Spread across 65 acres of land, Jatayu Earth's Centre is a rock-themed park built to promote mythology and adventure. The world’s largest bird sculpture is the main attraction at Jatayupara Nature Park and is one among the several Kollam famous places.
                It has a 6D theatre, a digital audio-visual room, cable car and the Siddha Cave Healing Centre. The virtual reality museum here tells the story of Jatayu to visitors. It is also home to umpteen adventure activities including paintball,
                laser tag, archery, bouldering, rock climbing, air-rifle shooting, zip lining, trekking, rappelling, valley crossing, etc.

            <p>
                The park located near the town of Chadayamangalam (Jatayumangalam), which was named for Jatayu. Jatayu was a demi-god in Ramayana (a Hindu epic) who had the form of a vulture. According to the epic, Ravana was attempting to abduct Sita to Lanka when Jatayu
                tried to rescue her. Jatayu fought valiantly with Ravana, but as Jatayu was very old Ravana soon defeated him, clipping his wings, and Jayatu fell onto the rocks in Chadayamangalam. Rama and Lakshmana while on the search for Sita, chanced
                upon the stricken and dying Jatayu, who informed them of the battle with Ravana and told them that Ravana had headed South.
            </p>

            <h3>THANGASSERY LIGHTHOUSE </h3>

            <br>
            <p>
                Looking for the best tourist places in Kollam? The Thangassery Lighthouse, also known as the Tangasseri Light House, boasts of being the second tallest on the entire coast of Kerala and is thus even one of the most visited lighthouses in the state on
                this account. The tower has a total height of 41 metres, or 135 feet, and has been operational since the year 1902.The majestic tower is clearly visible and distinct, with its painted red and white oblique bands, and looks pretty indeed
                in all its glory and majesty.
            </p>
            <p>
                Tangasseri Lighthouse or Thangassery Lighthouse is situated at Tangasseri in Kollam city of the Indian state of Kerala.It is one of the two lighthouses in the Kollam Metropolitan Area and is maintained by the Cochin Directorate General of Lighthouses
                and Lightships.In operation since 1902,the cylindrical lighthouse tower painted with white and red oblique bands has a height of 41 metres (135 ft), making it the second tallest lighthouse in Kerala coast.Tangasseri Lighthouse is one of
                the most visited lighthouses in Kerala
            </p>
            <p>
                Prior to construction of the lighthouse, the British East India company had installed a tower with an oil lamp. In 1902 the present Tangasseri Lighthouse was completed, which by 1930 had suffered cracks in the tower that required jacketing masonry to
                be installed.The light source was modified in 1932, 1940, 1962, 1967, 1990 and 1994.
            </p>
            <p>
                The lighthouse is located on the coast at Tangasseri in Kollam city and is the one of the locations in India that still maintains Anglo-Indian culture. Tangasseri is home to remnants of an ancient Portuguese built coastal defence, the St Thomas Fort,
                a Portuguese Cemetery, a canal, the ancient Port of Quilon and the Infant Jesus Cathedra

            <br>
            <p>
                Palaruvi Waterfalls, which literally translates to ‘Stream of Milk’. The white-stream waterfall descending from the height of 300ft resembles the shape of a horse’s tail. An ideal time to visit this place is from June to January. It is the 32nd highest
                waterfall in India, also known to have Ayurvedic properties. The roaring sounds of the fall stand in stark contrast to the silence of the forests and mist-kissed mountains around it, therefore making it among the best tourist spots in
                Kollam.

            <h3>SASTHAMKOTTA LAKE </h3>

            <br>
            <p>
                Sasthamkotta Lake is the largest of its kind in Kerala and said to have derived its name from an ancient Sastha Temple located near the lake. It is surrounded by hills on the 3 sides and is the largest source of drinking water for the residents of Kollam.
                The reason for it being a freshwater source is the presence of larva chaoborus in the water which is responsible of consuming bacteria from the lake water and makes its healthy and fit for drinking. The lake is home for 27 species of freshwater
                fish. You can do boating and swimming in this lake.
            </p>
            <p>
                The lake is located at a distance of 25 km from Quilon city, which is on the northern side of Ashtamudi Lake. Thiruvananthapuram International Airport, at 105 km, is the nearest airport to Kollam. Karunagapally, at a distance of 8 km, is the closest town
                to the lake. A ferry service across the lake transports people between West Kallada and Sasthamkotta.
            </p>

                Prior to construction of the lighthouse, the British East India company had installed a tower with an oil lamp. In 1902 the present Tangasseri Lighthouse was completed, which by 1930 had suffered cracks in the tower that required jacketing masonry to

            </p>
            <p>
                Except for an earthen embankment of 1.5 km length which separates the lake from the paddy fields on its southern side, bordering the alluvial plains of the Kallada River, all other sides of the lake are surrounded by hills which are steep and form narrow
                valleys. In the south and southwestern parts of the lake there are a number of smaller water bodies and waterlogged areas.The present area of the lake is 375 ha since large part of the lake is reported to have been occupied for agriculture.Rock
                formation of mainly archaean origin are recorded with intrusions of charnockite, biotite gneiss and dolerite dyke rocks. The Tertiary Varkala formations are observed along the coastal beds. In the valley portion, sand and silt deposits
                are recorded. Geomorphological divisions of the basin area of the lake comprise the undulating uplands which have fairly thick vegetation of mixed crops and plantations,the valley fills of laterite alluvium and colluvial deposits with
                low level areas which are intensely cultivated and thickly populated and the flood plains/alluvial plains of the Kallada River on the south that are mostly cultivated.
            </p>
            <P> The average annual runoff from the river system into the estuary is reported to be 76 cubic kilometers of freshwater.The basin drainage area is 1,700 km2 (660 mi2) and with an average annual rainfall of 2400 mm (94 in) it discharges 3.375
                km3 (2,740,000 ac·ft) of flow annually. It acts as a flood storage lake thus protecting the thickly populated city of Quilon (Kollam) and the coastal land. The Kallada dam built across the Kallada river is 85.3 m high by 35 m long (280
                ft by 115 ft) with a reservoir area of 23 km2 (8.9 mi2) with a storage volume of 0.505 km3 (409,000 ac·ft). Though it provides irrigation to 61630 ha for paddy and upland crops, it has aggravated the salinity ingress into the wetland and
                the river due to reduced outflows during summer months.

            <h3>ASHTAMUDI LAKE </h3>

            <br>
            <p>The incredible beauty of Kerala, Ashtamudi Lake, it’s name has been derived from two words 'Ashta' meaning eight and 'Mudi' meaning branch, thereby stating the fact that lake has eight branches. It’s the second largest lake in Kerala. Thick
                coconut groves and palm trees can be seen all along the banks of the lake. The banks of the lake are also famous for the Chinese fishing nets. Backwater cruises are also available in the lake, between Kollam and Alappuzha. The boat cruise
                to Munroe Islands is a wonderful experience. There are many resorts along the lake that offer variety of water sports.
            </p>
            <p>
                Ashtamudi Lake (Ashtamudi Kayal), in the Kollam District of the Indian state of Kerala, is the most visited backwater and lake in the state. It possesses a unique wetland ecosystem and a large palm-shaped (also described as octopus-shaped) water body,
                second only in size to the Vembanad estuary ecosystem of the state. Ashtamudi means 'eight braids' (Ashta : 'eight'; mudi : 'hair braids') in the local Malayalam language. The name is indicative of the lake's topography with its multiple
                branches. The lake is also called the gateway to the backwaters of Kerala and is well known for its houseboat and backwater resorts.Ashtamudi Wetland was included in the list of wetlands of international importance, as defined by the Ramsar
                Convention for the conservation and sustainable utilization of wetlands.
            </p>
            <p>
                Along both banks of the lake and its backwater canals, coconut groves and palm trees interspersed with towns and villages are seen. Kollam, (formerly Quilon) is an important historic port city located on the right bank of the lake. Boat cruises are operated
                by the Kollam Boat Club from Kollam to Alappuzha providing transport access to many other towns and villages along this route. Luxury houseboats also operate on the lake. The boat journey is an 8-hour trip, winding through lakes, canals
                and water bound villages.The lake and the city of Kollam on its banks and the Neendakara port at the confluence offer a means of transport for the state's trade and commerce in the cashew trading and processing industry as well as the
                marine products industry.
            </p>
            <p>
                Kallada River is a major river discharging into the Ashtamudi Lake. The Kallada river, which originates near Ponmudi from the Kulathupuzha hills Western Ghats is formed by the confluence of three rivers, viz., Kulathupuzha, Chenthurnipuzha, and Kalthuruthipuzha,
                and after traversing a distance of about 121 km (75 mi) through virgin forests finally debouches into the Ashtamudi wetland at Peringalam near Kollam. With a maximum depth of 21 ft (6.4 m) at the confluence, it is Kerala's deepest estuary
            </p>
            <P> There are no visible tributaries feeding the lake but springs at the bottom of the lake are stated to be one of the source which supply water throughout the year; volume of water in the lake is estimated to be of the order of 22.4 million
                cum.A thick 10–20 m mantle of kaolinite rich (derivative of laterite) soil around the lake is stated to check flow into the lake and the theory is now that the lake is also rain fed; the lake water level is recorded to be higher at the
                end of the monsoon season.The average annual rainfall in the area is 2398 mm and mean annual temperature varies between 26.7 °C and 29.16 °C. Ground water table in the area is reported at depth of 3.89 m. After accounting for estimated
                evaporation loss of 5 MCM (million cubic metres) and water utilized for domestic use of 8 MCM (at a pumpage rate of 22 MLD), the two together account for about two-thirds of the inflow.
