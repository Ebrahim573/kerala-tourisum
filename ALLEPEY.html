            <h3>KUTTANAD BACKWATERS </h3>

            <br>
            <p>
                One of the best places to visit in Alleppey is Kuttanad Backwaters. This isn’t a place, it’s a phenomenon. It is a spectacular lagoon, surrounded by the beauty of lakes, rivers, canals, misty mountains and ethereal landscapes.The experience of floating
                along the pristine backwaters on a houseboat is inexplicable. You will have to live it to know it! The place is also known as the ‘Rice bowl of Kerala,’ for its stunning rice plantations. If you are in Alleppey for a day, then this place
                should be your entire itinerary.
            </p>
            <p>
                Kuttanad is a region covering the Alappuzha, Kottayam and Pathanamthitta Districts, in the state of Kerala, India, well known for its vast paddy fields and geographical peculiarities. The region has the lowest altitude in India, and is one of the few
                places in the world where farming is carried on around 1.2 to 3.0 metres (4 to 10 ft) below sea level.Is historically important in the ancient history of South India and is the major rice producer in the state. Farmers of Kuttanad are
                famous for Biosaline Farming. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) has declared the Kuttanad Farming System as a Globally Important Agricultural Heritage System (GIAHS).
            </p>
            <p>
                Lower Kuttanadu comprises taluks of Ambalapuzha, Nedumudy, Kuttanadu (excluding Edathua, Thalavady, Kidangara and Muttar), and the northern half of Karthikapally taluk in Alappuzha district.
            </p>
            <P>
                Upper Kuttanad comprises Veeyapuram and Pallippad in Karthikapally taluk, Edathua, Thalavady, Kidangara and Muttar in Kuttanad taluk; Chennithala and Thripperumthura villages in Mavelikkara taluk; Mannar, Kurattissery, Budhanoor, Ennakkad villages in
                Chengannur taluk of Alappuzha district; and Parumala, Kadapra, Niranam, Pulikeezhu, Nedumpuram, Chathenkary, Peringara, and Kavumbhagam villages in Pathanamthitta district.
            </P>
            <P>
                North Kuttanad comprises Vaikom taluk, western parts of Kottayam taluk, and western parts of Changanacherry taluk in Kottayam district.
            </P>
            <P>
                The major occupation in Kuttanadu is farming, with rice the most important agricultural product. This activity gives the area its moniker of "The Rice Bowl of Kerala". Large farming areas near Vembanad Lake were reclaimed from the lake. The history of
                paddy cultivation in Kuttanad can be traced back centuries. The evolution of paddy cultivation correlated with technological advancement and changes in the regulatory framework that existed during the 19th and 20th centuries. In earlier
                times, reclamation was carried out mainly from the shallow part of the Vembanad Lake or from the periphery of the Pamba River. These reclamations constituted small areas of paddy fields called padasekharams. Bailing out of water from the
                fields were done manually using water wheels called chakram. Gradually the manual method used for bailing out of water gave way to steam engines
            </P>
            <P>
                Three distinct stages can be identified in the reclamation of kayal lands from the lake. The first stage was carried out by private entrepreneurs without any financial support from the government. The Pattom Proclamation made by the Travencore Kingdom
                in 1865, gave a great fillip to reclamation activities between 1865 and 1888. During this period de-watering of the polders was done manually using chakram, which restricted large-scale reclamation. Only about 250 hectares of land were
                reclaimed during this period. Venadu kayal and Madathil Kayal were reclaimed during this period and are considered the first "Kayal Nilams" to be reclaimed from the Vembanad Lake.These pioneering reclamation activities in kayal cultivation
                were made by the two brothers Mathai Luka Pallithanam and Ouseph Luka Pallithanam from Kainady village in Kuttanadu.The second phase started during 1888. One of the reclamation during this period was undertaken by Chalayil Eravi Kesava
                Panicker. He chose to reclaim Vembanad kayal from the mouth of the Chennamkari river as it joins with the back waters. The reclaimed kayal was known as ‘ Attumuttu Kayal’. Other major reclamation on the same year was Seminary Kayal which
                was undertaken by Kottayam Orthodox Seminary.
            </P>
            <P>
                Due to the steep decline in the price of rice between 1920 and 1940 reclamation activities slowed down, but they gained momentum again in the early 1940s. During this period, in order to increase agricultural output, a government initiated "Grow More
                Food" campaign and the provision of incentives encouraged new reclamations. The advent of electric motors made reclamation relatively easier, cheaper and less risky as compared to in earlier periods. The last tract of the reclamations
                namely Q, S and T block were made during this period by Thomman Joseph Murickummoottil (Muricken Outhachan) and his wife's family Puthanppura Panchara (Veliyanadu).
            </P>
            <P>
                In 1968, the Government of India proposed that a bund (Dam) be made across the river so that seawater would not be allowed to come inside Kuttanad during summer, allowing farmers to cultivate an extra crop per year. The project was planned in three phases,
                the south side, the north side and another phase to join the two sections. The project was delayed and by the time the first two phases were complete the entire money allotted for the project ran out and left the final phase in limbo.
                The farmers who were expecting many financial benefits after the completion of the project decided to take matters into their own hands and one night in 1972, a large group of farmers filled the gap between the north and the south side
                with earth. To this day, the earth embankment between the two sections of the bund remains. With this, it was possible to close the regulator of shutters during December–June when the saline water enters, and then open it during monsoon.
                Once the Thanneermukkam bund and spillway became operational two crops were possible in Kuttanad.
            </p>
            <p>
                Even though the bund has improved the quality of life of the farmers, the bund is alleged to have caused severe environmental problems. The backwaters which were abundant with fish and part of the staple food of the people of the region require a small
                amount of salt water for its breeding. The bund has caused deterioration of fish varieties in the region and the fishermen opposed to the bund as of 2005. The bund has also disrupted the harmony of the sea with the backwaters and has caused
                problems not foreseen before the bund like the omnipresence of the water weeds. Earlier the salt water tends to cleanse the backwaters but this does not happen any more leading to the pollution of the backwaters and the entire land near
                by.

            <h3>PANDAVAN ROCK </h3>

            <br>
            <p>
                Pandavan Rock is an amalgamation of breathtaking caves and glorious rock carvings. The natural beauty surrounding this site is bliss. It is said that the Pandavas stayed inside the cave during Mahabharata.Pandavan Rock is the stage for the enactment of
                the hordes of mythological stories one might have heard from the ancient epic of Mahabharata. Legend has it that the Pancha Pandavas had made a home of this cave in their wanderings in the forests during their exile, making this, a mythological
                as well as a historical tourist spot.

            </p>
            <p>
                Thus, it is one of the best places to see in Alleppey. It is also quite famous as a picnic spot. The route to the caves is easy but elder people should avoid the trail, in case they suffer from health problems. The rock caves are adjoined by the Kallada
                Dam, which is a tourist attraction as well.
            </p>
            <p>
                The cave has, of course, changed its appearance to a tiny hillock with the passage of time; don't expect to find a hollow cave with its walls covered in pictographic script!.It is an ideal picnic spot for a pleasant evening with the family. It takes an
                easy climb to reach the top of the rock, unless one is old or otherwise abled, getting to the top isn't very challenging. And once there, the panoramic view is spectacular!

            <h3>PATHIRAMANAL </h3>

            <br>
            <p>
                The name Pathiramanal means 'midnight sand'. The scenic beauty of both sides of the lake as well as that of the island is mind blowing. It is home to many rare varieties of migratory birds from different parts of the world.he Pathiramanal Island is 28.505
                ha. It is about 1.5 km from Muhamma boat jetty and about 13 km from Alapuzha. From the jetty close by Baker Bungalow the distance to the island is about 5 km and from Kumarakom 4 km towards northwest.
            </p>
            <p>
                The island (also known as Anantha Padmanabhan Thoppu) was purchased by Chevalier ACM Anthraper, from M/s Bheemji Devji Trust of Cochin and was under the private ownership of Thaimattathil Family until the late seventies.When Land Reforms Acts were enforced
                in the State in 1979, the island came under government ownership. The island was returned to the government as a surplus land that crossed the land ceiling. It was later transferred to the Tourism Department and the idea of leasing it
                out to private enterprises was under consideration. The island at present is uninhabited. Till late seventies of the 20th century 14 worker families resided in the island, who were later rehabilitated on the mainland in the Muhamma panchayath.
            </p>
            <p>
                The island is a birdwatcher's paradise. It is home to around 91 local species of birds and 50 migratory birds. One can see pintail ducks, common teal, night heron, cormorant, darter, Indian shag, purple heron, gulls, terns, large egrets, intermediate
                egret, cattle egret, Indian pond heron, little egret, pheasant-tailed and bronze-winged jacanas, stork-billed kingfisher, watercock, whistling duck, cotton pygmy-goose, little cormorant and whiskered tern. Some people have even reported
                seeing the monarch flycatcher.It is also completely uninhabited so you don’t have to worry about the crowd and hawkers disrupting the beauty. However, because it is uninhabited and not a major tourist hotspot, you will find that it lacks
                the usual facilities that bring tourists to comfort like benches in order to sit, restrooms, and places to buy food from. Let this not be a distraction since the island is very small and can be toured within an hour, which means that you
                won’t necessarily be inconvenienced by the lack of facilities, especially if you go prepared.
            </p>
            <p>
                The island is an hour and half drive by motor boat or 30 minutes by speed boat from Alappuzha town. One can also take the boats plying in the Muhamma-Kumarakom water route. The SWTD boats plying in the Muhamma-Kumarakom water route no longer stops at
                Pathiramanal. It takes around 40 minutes from Kumarakom to reach Pathiramanal. The journey through Vembanad Lake is a marvellous experience. The best way to reach Pathiramanal is by renting a boat from Kayippuram jetty, which is just about
                1 km east of the Kayippuram junction on the Alappuzha - Thannirmukkam road.The ride across Lake Vembanad is lovely as is the experience of walking through the island. If you happen to visit in the right season, you will find yourself surrounded
                by the chirpy sounds of thousands of birds. This certainly makes for one of the places to visit in Alleppey.

            <h3>VEMBANAD LAKE </h3>

            <br>
            <p>Vembanad, also known as Punnamada is the longest lake in India,as well as the largest lake in the state of Kerala. With an area of 2033 square kilometers and a maximum length of 96.5 km, it is the second largest Ramsar site in India only after
                the Sunderbans in West Bengal. Spanning several districts in the state of Kerala, it is known as Vembanadu Lake in Kottayam, Vaikom, Changanassery, Punnamada Lake in Alappuzha, Punnappra, Kuttanadu and Kochi Lake in Kochi. Several groups
                of small islands including Vypin, Mulavukad, Maradu, Udayamperoor, Vallarpadam, Willingdon Island are located in the Kochi Lake portion. Kochi Port is built around the Willingdon Island and the Vallarpadam island.
            </p>
            <p>
                The most popular location on the shores of the lake is the Kumarakom Tourist Village situated on the east coast of the lake.The Kumarakom Bird Sanctuary is located on the northern fringes of Kumarakom village. The Vembanad Wetland system was included
                in the list of wetlands of international importance, as defined by the Ramsar Convention for the conservation and sustainable utilization of wetlands in 2002. It is the largest of the three Ramsar Sites in the state of Kerala. Vembanad
                lake has been heavily reclaimed over the course of the past century with the water spread area reducing from 290.85 km² in 1917 to 227 km² in 1971 and 213.28 km² in 1990. In the same period almost 63.62 km of erstwhile water spread were
                reclaimed primarily for the formation of polders and to enlarge the extent of the Wellington island of Cochin port. The lake faces a major ecological crisis and has reduced to 37 percent of its original area, as a result of land reclamation.
            </p>
            <p>
                A unique characteristic of the lake is the 1,252 metres (4,108 ft)-long Thanneermukkom salt water barrier constructed as a part of the Kuttanad Development Scheme to prevent tidal action and intrusion of salt water into the Kuttanad low-lands. It is the
                largest mud regulator in India and essentially divides the lake into two parts – one with perennial brackish water and the other with fresh water from rivers draining into the lake. This barrier has helped farmers in Kuttanad by freeing
                the area of salinity and allowing them an additional crop in the dry season. The Thanneermukkom barrier is located at one of the narrower parts of the Vembanad Lake. Only two-thirds of the original number of gates are opened in July to
                release flood flow. These gates remain closed until mid-November. The main drawback of the structure has been the loss of opportunity for fish and prawns to migrate upstream, and also an increase in weed growth in the upstream, severely
                restricting the natural flushing of pollutants. The Thanneermukkom bund has also created ecological problems, primarily, the rampant propagation of the Water Hyacinth in fresh water.
            </p>
            <p>
                Vembanad Lake is at the heart of Kerala Backwaters tourism with hundreds of kettuvallams plied on it and numerous resorts on its banks. The Kumarakom Bird Sanctuary is located on the east coast of the lake. The lake has become a major tourist attraction.
                A generally safe destination, this place had just one incident of tourist harassment in 2004 as reported in The Times of India.
            </p>
            <P> The Vembanad Wetland system has formed an intricate network of estuaries, lagoons and canals which spans over 196 km in the north–south and 29 km in the east–west directions. Almost all villages in these areas can be accessed via water transport.
                The major rivers of Muvattupuzha, Meenachil, Pamba and Achencovil rivers, are all navigable up to distances of about 30 km upstream in the tidal reach. The Kottappuram–Kollam segment of the west coast canal system has a major chunk passing
                through the Vembanad Lake and spans a total of 209 km. It has been declared as a National Waterway.

            <h3>KAYAMKULAM LAKE </h3>

            <br>
            <p>
                Kayamkulam Kayal, Kayamkulam Lake or Kayamkulam Estuary is a shallow brackish water lagoon streaching between Panmana and Karthikapally. It has an outlet to the Arabian sea at Kayamkulam barrage.The Kayal used to be connected to the sea most of the time
                except during dry season when a bar like formation separates it from the sea.Now the bar has been opened up permanently for construction of Kayamkulam Fishing Harbor.Kayamkulam boat race is conducted in Kayamkulam Kayal.
            </p>
            <p>
                There is a popular belief that Kayamkulam kayal was once lush green fields and Kayamkulam Raja, angry and desolate from being defeated by Travancore King Marthanda Varma, ordered his naval officers, Arattupuzha Arayars, to rupture the barrier separating
                it from the sea and let salt water in to make the fields un-cultivable.It is believed that when Kayamkulam was annexed the King threw all the valuables in his palace into Kayamkulam lake and fled the Kingdom.
            </p>
            <p>
                Kayamkulam Kayal lies between latitudes 9°2'N and 9°16'N and longitudes 76°25'E and 76°32'E. The backwater occupies area in both Alappuzha district and Kollam of the total 1,652.33 hectares (4,083.0 acres), 140.58 hectares (347.4 acres) is in Kollam district
                and the rest 1,511.75 hectares (3,735.6 acres) in Alappuzha district.The Kayal has high length to width ratio and is almost a linear water body. It fall within the Survey of India(501) topographic sheets 58C/8 and 58C/12. The Kayal is
                connected to Vembanad Kayal in the north and Ashtamudi Kayal in the south
            </p>
            <p>
                Kallada River is a major river discharging into the Ashtamudi Lake. The Kallada river, which originates near Ponmudi from the Kulathupuzha hills Western Ghats is formed by the confluence of three rivers, viz., Kulathupuzha, Chenthurnipuzha, and Kalthuruthipuzha,
                and after traversing a distance of about 121 km (75 mi) through virgin forests finally debouches into the Ashtamudi wetland at Peringalam near Kollam. With a maximum depth of 21 ft (6.4 m) at the confluence, it is Kerala's deepest estuary
            </p>
            <P> The Kayal used to be connected to the sea most of the time but during dry season the sediments from the inflows separate the Kayal from the sea by forming a bar like formation and during the rainy season the bar is cut open by rivers and the
                Kayal was connected to the sea.[5] Now the bar has been opened up permanently for construction of Kayamkulam Fishing Harbor.

                Quality of water in the Kayal is highly dependent on the season as it is connected to both sea and fresh water rivers. The salinity of the water is highly season dependent and it also exhibits a gradient. In monsoon season salinity is 11% while in dry
                season it 30% almost that of a marine system. Presence of heavy metals is quite low and there is marked decrease in monsoon season due to heavy inflow. Levels of toxic material is below detectable limit. These estimations were done before
                setting up of Rajiv Gandhi CCPP on the banks of the Kayal. A study after setting up of the power plant reported that the temperature of cooling effluents were perceptibly higher than the lake water and the dissolved oxygen contend also
                fell near the plant site.

            <P>
                the lake water and the dissolved oxygen contend also fell near the plant site.[13] The water was studied by Central Inland Fisheries Research Institute after NTPC was set up. Recorded pH values vary from 6.75 (May 2000) to 8.3 (April 2002). Mean water
                temperature is 29.5 °C (85.1 °F)(2002). Biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5) values, Chemical oxygen demand(COD) values and nutrient content were high, these were attributed to NTPC effluent discharge and retting of coconut husks.

                The Kayal directly serves as the means of livelihood of thousands of fishermen. The chief catch is grey millets and prawns. The main fishing season is from October to January during the season the Kayal will be connected to the sea. The majority of fish
                are caught using any one of cast net, gill net, scare net, seine net, dip net, ring net, scoope net or trap. Arattupuzha, a fishing village on the bank of Kayamkulam Kayal, is famous for chakara mud formation resulting from thronging of
                large amount of fish and prawns.

                National waterway 3 passes through Kayamkulam Kayal. Total length of waterway in the Kayal is approximately 25 kilometres (16 mi) and Least Available Depth is at least 1.5 metres (4 ft 11 in). Kayamkulam Kayal had been drenched for creation of the Waterway.
                There is an IWT terminal in Kayamkulam occupying an area of 1.6304 acres (0.6598 ha).
