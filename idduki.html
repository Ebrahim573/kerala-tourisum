            <h3>MUNNAR </h3>

            <br>
            <p>
                Munnar is a town and hill station on Western Ghats mountain ranges located in the Idukki district of the southwestern Indian state of Kerala. Munnar is situated at around 1,600 metres (5,200 ft) above mean sea level,in the Western Ghats mountain range.
                Munnar is also called the "Kashmir of South India" and is a popular honeymoon destination.
            </p>
            <p>
                The region has been inhabited by hunter-gatherer tribals like the Malayarayan and Muthuvan for thousands of years.Tradition states that Colonel Arthur Wellesley, later the Duke of Wellington, was the first British person to pass through Munnar during
                Tippu Sultan's campaign in Travancore, but this is unsubstantiated. The first survey of the terrain was undertaken by Benjamin Swayne Ward in 1816–1817, who followed the Periyar into the Western Ghats and established a camp at the confluence
                of three rivers, from which the name of Munnar is derived.
            </p>
            <p>
                It was to be nearly 50 years later that Sir Charles Trevelyan, Governor of Madras, instructed Col. Douglas Hamilton to explore the hill country in the western part of the Madras Presidency, requesting special advice on the feasibility of establishing
                sanatoria for the British in the South and of developing revenue- earning projects without endangering the environment, as had happened in Ceylon where coffee had destroyed not only the rain forest but also paddy cultivation in the north-central
                rice bowl of ancient Ceylon. Hamilton climbed throughout the Ghats in Munnar region. 15 years later, John Daniel Munro noted that much of Munnar's land was suitable for coffee plantations. Munro, Henry Turn and his half-brother AW Turner
                obtained ownership of the Cardamom Hills from the Raja of Travancore and began clearing forest around Devikulam in 1879. Soon many other Europeans began establishing tea plantations in the area throughout the 1880s. Early plantations had
                few facilities and were mainly huts of straw. Most labourers on the tea estates were Dalits from present-day Tamil Nadu.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 1900, a ropeway was built and eventually monorails were installed for easier transport of goods to the plains. In 1901, P. R. Buchanan took over as General Manager and began the most extensive clearing of jungles for plantations. In 1908, construction
                started on a new railway which opened in 1909. By 1911, around 16,000 acres of the region was under cultivation.In 1924, a flood swept through Munnar, damaged the road and destroyed the rail track. In its place it was decided to create
                a ropeway to transport tea. In 1930, this in turn was replaced by a modern road that made transport much easier. By 1952, almost 28,000 acres of land was under cultivation. After Independence, Indian planters took over. In 1964, the KDHC
                which owned most tea estates was acquired by Tata and Finlay who started the first instant tea factory in the country. In 1971, the Kerala government wanted to reforest all land in the hills not used for plantations. However negotiations
                that followed resulted in Tata keeping most of the land, leaving it with 57,000 acres.The former Kunda Valley Railway in Munnar was destroyed by a flood in 1924, but tourism officials are considering reconstructing the railway line to
                attract tourists.
            </p>
            <P>
                Geographic coordinates of Munnar is 10°05′21″N 77°03′35″E. Munnar town is situated on the Kannan Devan Hills village in Devikulam taluk and is the largest panchayat in the Idukki district covering an area of nearly 557 square kilometres (215 sq mi).

            <h3>VAGAMON</h3>

            <br>
            <p>
                Vagamon is an Indian hill station and a revenue village primarily located in Peerumedu taluk of Idukki district (majority area including Vagamon town), and also Meenachil taluk and Kanjirappally taluk of Kottayam district in the state of Kerala, India...
                Gifted with magnificent hill formations, natural attractions and panoramic views Vagamon has emerged as a major tourist destination in the recent times comparable with places like Munnar and Kumarakam in popularity.
            </p>
            <P>
                Vagamon does not have a long history to boast of as it had remained unexplored for centuries. Though the British had plantations here, it was only in 1926, when Walter Duncan and Company started their tea plantations here, that it became well-known. In
                the 1930s, more tea plantations were set up in the area.After 1940 people from Travancore mostly from southern Travancore and people from Madras (Tamil Nadu) migrated to Vagamon.Later after the formation of Kerala State people from various
                parts of kerala are migrated there. In the 1950s, the famed Kurisumala Ashram was set up here and that was the turning point in its development into a well-known place. National Geographic Traveler has listed Vagamon on their directory
                of the "50 most attractive places to visit in India".
            </P>
            <P>
                As of 2011 Census, Vagamon had a population of 14,641 with 7,212 males and 7,429 females. Vagamon village has an area of 78.3 km2 (30.2 sq mi) with 3,816 families residing in it. The average sex ratio was 1030 lower than the state average of 1084. In
                Vagamon, 9% of the population was under 6 years of age. Vagamon had an average literacy of 90.9% higher than the national average of 74% and lower than the state average of 94%
            </P>
            <P>
                Vagamon due to the influence of its elevation and climate has a unique ecosystem... leading to the emergence of rich natural vegetation, plant species, shola forests etc.. from early 20th century started plantation crops like tea, coffee.. Vagamon hills
                are home to less explored flora and fauna. A faunal diversity study conducted by Dr Pratheesh Mathew has recorded about 112 species of moths from 16 families under eight superfamilies that have become the prominent faunal diversity study
                in this area. The author has also recorded sitings of many species of insects, annelids, amphibians, lizards, snakes, birds and mammals. Wide variety of flowering and non-flowering plants including rare Cycas species have also been noted.
                The ongoing faunal and floral surveys are expected to shed light on the richness of biodiversity at this location. The flourishing tourism and related developments are predicted to create a negative impact on the flora and fauna of this
                region

            <h3>IDDUKI ARCH DAM </h3>

            <br>
            <p>
                The Idukki Dam is a double curvature Arch dam constructed across the Periyar River in a narrow gorge between two granite hills locally known as Kuravan and Kurathi in Mariyapuram village in Idukki District in Kerala, India. At 168.91 metres (554.2 ft),
                it is one of the highest arch dams in Asia. It is constructed and owned by the Kerala State Electricity Board. It supports a 780 MW hydroelectric power station in Moolamattom, which started generating power on 4 October 1975.The dam type
                is a concrete, double curvature parabolic, thin arc dam.The Indo-Canadian project was inaugurated by the Prime Minister Indira Gandhi on February 17, 1976.
            </p>
            <p>
                This dam was constructed along with two other dams at Cheruthoni and Kulamavu. Together, the three dams and Two saddle dams, Kulamavu Saddle Dam (Near Junction) and Kulamavu Saddle Dam (Right Bank) have created an artificial lake that is 60 km2 (23 sq
                mi) in area. The stored water is used to produce electricity at the Moolamattom Power house, which is located inside nearby rocky caves.
            </p>
            <p>
                The idea of constructing a dam for power generation was first conceived in 1919 in a report submitted by Italian engineer Jacob to the Travancore government, which was rejected. As per history, Shri Chemban Karuvellayan Kolumban,the head of 'Oorali' tribe
                during 1922, showed the way to the Malankara Estate Superintendent W.J.John and his friend AC Thomas Edattu, who were on hunting trip to forests near the present Arch Dam. Upon hearing the legend of Kuravan and Kurathi Hills, Thomas impressed
                by the sight of water flow between the mountains; suggested the spot suitable for an Arch dam. In 1932, W.J.John submitted a report to the Government of Travancore on the possibility of constructing a dam at Idukki for Power Generation.In
                1947, a preliminary investigation report was prepared and submitted by Sri. P. Joseph John, the then Chief Electrical Engineer to the Government of Travancore. It was during 1956 that the Central Water Commission conducted a detailed investigation
                based on the Government's request. The project report was prepared in 1961 and the Planning Commission accorded sanction for implementing the scheme in 1963. In 1964, under the leadership of Sri. E.U.Philipose, Superintending Engineer,
                preliminary works of the project were started.
            </p>
            <p>
                he construction of this Dam commenced on 30 April 1969. The project lead by Dr.D.Babu Paul IAS, who appointed as Project Coordinator, Idukki Hydel Project & District Collector with several engineers like Sri. C.V Mathews, Sri. M. Ramachandran, (Retired
                Chief Engineers, Kerala State Electricity Board) . The Government of Canada aided the Project with long-term loans and grants. SNC-Lavalin, Canada, a well-known firm of Consulting Engineers were advising and assisting Project Engineers
                under Canadian aid, while Hindustan Construction Company (a.k.a. HCC) of Walchand group won the bid for construction.
            </p>
            <P> Idukki Dam is 168.91 m (554.2 ft) tall, constructed between the two mountains - Kuravanmala (839 m (2,753 ft)) and Kurathimala (925 m (3,035 ft)). Length of the dam on its top is 365.85 m (1,200.3 ft). It has a width of 7.62 m (25.0 ft) in
                the top and 19.81 m (65.0 ft) in the bottom. About 464,000 m3 (16,400,000 cu ft) of concrete was used in the construction of the dam. This project is situated in Idukki District and its underground power house is located at Moolamattom
                which is about 43 km (27 mi) from the dam. One thing to be noted is, Idukki Arch dam doesn't have any shutters to be opened so it has to rely on the Cheruthoni dam to maintain the reservoir water level.
